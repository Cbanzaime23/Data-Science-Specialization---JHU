## Executive Summary

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Exploratory Data Analysis 

Load the mtcars dataset
```{r}
data(mtcars)
mtcars
head(mtcars)
```

Show summary
```{r}
summary(mtcars)
str(mtcars)
```

Convert to factors the "vs" and "am"
```{r}
mtcars$vs <- as.factor(mtcars$vs)
mtcars$am <- as.factor(mtcars$am)
str(mtcars)
names(mtcars)
num <- length(mtcars$am)
```

Set 1 = Automatic and 0 = Manual
```{r}
levels(mtcars$am) <- c("Automatic", "Manual")
names(mtcars)[9]<-paste("Transmission")
```


The interquartile range of Manual Transmission is higher than Automatic Transmission when it comes to Miles per Gallon. Let's test this hypothesis.
Perform a t.test between the mean of Automatic and Manual for MPG
(Assuming equal variance,Assuming unequal variance)


First we need to split the data
```{r}
Auto.Transmission <- subset(mtcars,select=mpg, Transmission == "Automatic")
Manual.Transmission <- subset(mtcars,select=mpg,Transmission == "Manual")
```

assuming equal variance between the two groups
```{r}
t.test(Auto.Transmission,Manual.Transmission, var.equal = TRUE)
```

assuming unequal variance between the two groups
```{r}
t.test(Auto.Transmission,Manual.Transmission, var.equal = FALSE)
```

We showed that the difference between the mpg of Automatic and Manual is significant

Calculate the significant diffenrence
```{r}
Signif.Diff <- mean(Manual.Transmission$mpg) - mean(Auto.Transmission$mpg)
Signif.Diff
```

Do a regression analysis to verify the result of out t.test
```{r}
LinReg <- lm(mpg ~ Transmission, data = mtcars)$coeff
'''

Do a regression analysis to determine the coefficient/s that is/are significant
```{r}
MultLinReg <- lm(mpg ~., data = mtcars)
summary(MultLinReg)
summary(MultLinReg)$coeff
'''
